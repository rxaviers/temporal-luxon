# Temporal (powered by luxon)

## Why?

[TC39 Proposal: Temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) is a fantastic API for dealing with dates and times. While we wait its addition to ECMAScript (JavaScript), this package serves as an alternative to experimenting the future today.

## What?

This package provides [TC39 Proposal: Temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) API, using [luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon) as engine under the hoods.

For Temporal polyfils that follows specs more strictly, please use **[@js-temporal/polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-temporal/polyfill)** or [js-temporal/temporal-polyfill](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill).
